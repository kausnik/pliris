## The Firm

Pliris Consulting was founded by Nikhil Kaushal to bring private-sector rigor to public-sector challenges. Based in Victoria, BC, with deep roots in Saskatchewan, the firm specializes in bridging the gap between policy intent and technology execution.

## Our Approach

We work within the unique constraints of government—procurement cycles, privacy legislation, union agreements, accessibility mandates—to deliver solutions that actually work in the real world. Every engagement is shaped by the reality that public sector technology must serve citizens, satisfy oversight, and survive political cycles.

## Experience

Nikhil brings 15+ years of experience across provincial governments (BC, Saskatchewan), crown corporations, utilities, insurance, and telecommunications. That breadth means we understand not just how technology works, but how government works—and how to make the two work together.
