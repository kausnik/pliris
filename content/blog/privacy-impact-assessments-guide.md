Privacy Impact Assessments are one of the most misunderstood requirements in government technology projects. Done poorly, they become bureaucratic checkboxes that delay projects without improving privacy. Done well, they become design tools that produce better systems.

## What a PIA Actually Is

A Privacy Impact Assessment evaluates how a proposed system or process will collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information. In Canadian provincial contexts, PIAs are typically required under provincial privacy legislation whenever a new system handles personal information.

The assessment considers questions like: What personal information is being collected? Is the collection necessary for the stated purpose? How will the information be protected? Who will have access? How long will it be retained?

## The Common Mistake

Most organizations treat PIAs as compliance documents — something that gets written at the end of a project to satisfy a privacy officer. This approach guarantees one of two outcomes: either the PIA identifies problems too late to fix without significant rework, or the PIA becomes a rubber stamp that doesn't actually protect privacy.

## PIAs as Design Tools

The better approach is to treat PIAs as design inputs. Conduct the assessment early — during requirements gathering, not after development is complete. When you understand privacy constraints upfront, you can design systems that are privacy-protective by default.

This means involving your privacy officer in architecture discussions, not just review cycles. It means mapping data flows before building them. It means asking "do we actually need this data?" before collecting it.

## Practical Steps

Start with a data flow diagram. Map every piece of personal information from collection to disposition. Identify every system, person, and process that touches the data.

Then assess each flow against the privacy principles in your applicable legislation. Is collection limited to what's necessary? Is use limited to the stated purpose? Are there appropriate safeguards?

Document your findings, your mitigations, and your residual risks. Submit for review with enough time to actually address any concerns.

## The Payoff

Organizations that integrate PIAs into their development process don't just achieve compliance — they build better systems. Privacy-protective design often produces simpler architectures, cleaner data flows, and more maintainable systems.

The goal isn't to pass a review. The goal is to build technology that serves citizens while respecting their right to privacy.
