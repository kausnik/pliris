Every government organization wants better reporting. Power BI has become the default choice for most Canadian provincial agencies, and for good reason — it's cost-effective, integrates well with the Microsoft ecosystem most governments already use, and produces professional-looking dashboards.

But dashboards aren't the hard part.

## The Data Quality Problem

The real challenge in government BI isn't visualization — it's data quality and governance. Most provincial agencies have data spread across dozens of systems: legacy mainframes, SharePoint lists, Excel spreadsheets maintained by individual analysts, and enterprise systems that were never designed to talk to each other.

Before building a single dashboard, you need to answer fundamental questions. Where does this data come from? Who owns it? How often is it updated? What are the privacy implications of combining datasets?

## Governance-First BI

At BC Hydro, we approached the Supply Chain Intelligence project by first establishing a reporting governance model — defining who owns which metrics, how data quality issues get escalated, and what the approval process looks like for new reports.

This governance-first approach means dashboards get built on a foundation that can actually be maintained. Too many BI projects produce impressive demos that fall apart within months because nobody defined who's responsible for keeping the data accurate.

## The Treasury Board Dimension

Government reporting has a dimension that private sector BI rarely encounters: legislated accountability. Treasury Board submissions, annual reports, and freedom of information requests all create reporting obligations that must be built into any BI strategy.

This isn't a constraint to work around — it's a design requirement. The best government BI implementations serve both operational decision-making and public accountability simultaneously.

## Practical Recommendations

If you're starting a BI initiative in a government context, start with governance. Define your data owners. Map your data flows. Understand your privacy obligations. Then build dashboards.

The technology is the easy part. The organizational alignment is what determines whether your BI investment produces lasting value or becomes another abandoned project.
